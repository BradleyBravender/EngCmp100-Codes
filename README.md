# EngCmp100-Codes
A series of programs I wrote / completed / refactored in my 'Computer Programming for Engineers' course.

Only to be used by future UAlberta EngCmp100 students with express ackowledgement of myself, and with honest reporting of the percentage of your program I contributed to if any.
